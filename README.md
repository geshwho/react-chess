# react-chess
Just for fun project to create a chess game with mostly react.

I'll use create-react-app to start.
Other requirements will come as I go!

## Things to be implemented (basically everything)
- Possible Component Structure
  - Board
  - Square
  - Piece
- Utilize chess.js or write everything from scratch??
- Drag and Drop to move pieces
- Click and click to move pieces
- Identify Legal Moves
  - Including things like castling and en passant
- Identify Endgame/Stalemate
- Identify Check
- Log of moves made during game
- Track Win/Loss
  - There is no backend :o
- Advanced:
  - Figure out a way to add chess engine to play a computer:
  - e.g. stockfish
  - Nonstandard games
    - Chess 960
    - Anti-Chess
    - etc..
